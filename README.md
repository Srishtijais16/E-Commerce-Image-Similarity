# E-Commerce Product Image Similarity Project  

This project focuses on building an AI-driven system that identifies e-commerce products based on image similarity. Users can upload an image, and the system fetches the exact or the most similar product from the database.  

## Features  
- **Exact Match Retrieval**: Displays the product that matches the uploaded image.  
- **Similar Product Recommendations**: Suggests similar products when an exact match is not found.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to extract image features for similarity comparisons.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Machine Learning**: MobileNetV2 for feature extraction  
- **Database**: SQLite  
- **Deployment**: PythonAnywhere
